                <h2>Father of Pakistan’s Nuclear Program</h2>
                <p><b>Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan</b> is remembered as the man who turned Pakistan’s dream of security and dignity into reality.  
                    Born in 1936, he rose from a humble beginning to become the architect of Pakistan’s nuclear strength.  
                    With quiet confidence and unshakable patriotism, he built the uranium enrichment facility at Kahuta when the world doubted Pakistan’s ability.  
                    He did not work for fame or reward, but for the safety of his homeland and the generations yet to come.  
                    At a time when Pakistan stood vulnerable, his courage gave the nation a shield no enemy could break.  
                    He believed that true independence is not given by others—it is earned through knowledge, discipline and sacrifice.  
                    For this reason, the people call him “Mohsin-e-Pakistan,” the benefactor who strengthened the nation’s backbone.  
                    His life is a lesson that one determined individual, guided by purpose, can change the destiny of millions.  
                    Though he passed away in 2021, his legacy lives in every heart that beats for Pakistan.  
                    Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan will forever be honoured as the Father of Pakistan’s Nuclear Program.</p>
